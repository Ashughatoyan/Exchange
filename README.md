## Hi ðŸ‘‹ everyone this project we call CONVEX.

CONVEX became the initial version of the platform for the sale of crypto-currencies in Armenia.
Later the 2nd version of the platform was developed with a more complex back-end structure.

CONVEX is a website where visitors, after registration, are anticipating the opportunity to buy crypto-currency.
it contains:
  Users dashbord for searching purchuase history
  Integrated Stripe payment system
  Platform using firebase as user information and all transaction DB

This repository contains a version of CONVEX that was still in development, but for the presentation of my skills to visitors from UpWork, it is completely sufficient. So don't pay attention to the file structure in the project cause it changed to the final version of the product.

## You can just look at the demo.mov file, where you will see how the application works with the stripe system and stores user records in the database.
